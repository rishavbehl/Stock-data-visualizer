# Stock-data-visualizer
This is a Python-based desktop application that fetches real-time daily stock market data using the Alpha Vantage API and visualizes closing prices through interactive line charts. The application provides a simple graphical user interface built with Tkinter, allowing users to enter a stock symbol and instantly view historical stock trends.

The project integrates API handling, data preprocessing, and visualization using Pandas and Matplotlib. It converts raw JSON data into structured DataFrames, cleans and formats the dataset, and plots closing prices over time. This project demonstrates practical implementation of Python GUI development, REST API integration, and data visualization techniques.

It is ideal for beginners looking to learn Python desktop applications, financial data analysis, and real-world API usage.
